            <p>In <a href="/">celestia.io</a>, you control a circular celestial <span title="or monster">life-form</span> in a race to become the largest of them all.  Stars are your food &ndash; the more you eat, the bigger you'll become.  To aid your quest, you may use boost, which makes you faster, or fire red stars at hostile life in this universe.</p>
            <p>But beware of red stars flung in your direction by other beings in this universe.  If those red stars collide into you, you'll lose some of your life force &ndash; the glow around you which keeps you alive.  If you run out of life force, you will explode in a spectacular supernova, returning your mass to the universe for others to feed on.</p>
            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <ul class="nobullet">
                <li><span class="controlhighlight">Mouse</span> to move</li>
                <li><span class="controlhighlight">Left click</span> to fire red stars</li>
                <li><span class="controlhighlight">Spacebar</span> or <span class="controlhighlight">Right click</span> to boost</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When playing this game from a touch screen tablet or phone, there are on-screen buttons for boosting and firing red stars.  Gameplay might not be as smooth on slower processors.</p>
